Here is a (temporary) git repository for LuaLaTeX files. It contains (or will contain) the following packages:

luatextra : the equivalent of xltxtra for LuaTeX.
luamcallbacks: only one lua file, automatically loaded by luatextra, to be able to register several functions in a callback.
luamplib: simple package to typeset metapost directly in TeX with LuaTeX's mplib.
luainputenc: package with two functions: making LaTeX's inputenc work, and conversion from and two a lot of encodings.
